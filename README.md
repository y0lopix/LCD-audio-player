# Monitor audio player

Some LCD monitors emit noises when the display refreshes depending on the screen content.

Import any audio file and your screen will play the sound. Don't forget to turn off your speakers.

⚠️ Warning: flashing bars will appear in fullscreen. Don't use this if you have photosensitive epilepsy.
